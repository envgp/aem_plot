## Prerequisites

**Software**

* Some knowledge of Python is assumed.
* All coding will be done in Jupyter notebooks. I'll explain how they work
  briefly but it will help if you've used them before.
* We'll use [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and
  [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/)
  You don't need to be an expert in these tools but some familiarity will help.
* For 3D visualizations, we will use [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) and [Leapfrog](https://www.seequent.com/products-solutions/leapfrog-geo/)

**Airborne Electromagnetic Mehtod**
* AEM (Airborne Electromagnetic Method) is an effective methodology to image hydrogeology of the subsurface in a large area. 
* For further details about the AEM method see: [AEM method](https://em.geosci.xyz/content/geophysical_surveys/airborne_tdem/index.html)
* As a motivating example, we will use a resistivity model from Kaweah Subbasin located in the Central Valley of California, USA. 

## Usage

There are a few things you'll need to follow the tutorial:

1. A working Python installation ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
2. The SimPEG *conda environment* installed
3. A web browser that works with Jupyter
   (basically anything except Internet Explorer)

To get things setup, please do the following.

**Windows users:** When you see "*terminal*" in the instructions,
this means the "*Anaconda Prompt*" program for you.

### Step 1: Python

**Follow the general instructions for installing Anaconda:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgLft9vxdduAW-jmhYqXvtfGYJS6v2FjM

This will get you a working Python 3 installation with the `conda` package
manager. If you already have one, you can skip this step.

### Step 2: Download the AEM Plot tutorials

To access the notebooks, you need to use git to clone this repository

To clone this repository, open up a terminal and navigate to where you want this repository stored on your computer.

Then run
```
git clone https://github.com/envgp/aem_plot.git
```
to clone the repository, and `cd` into the `aem_plot` directory
```
cd aem_plot
```

### Step 3: Create the AEM plot tutorial conda environment

From inside of the `aem_plot` repository, create the `aem_plot` conda environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
and activate the environment
```
conda activate aem_plot
```

### Step 4: Launching the notebooks

Once you have activated the conda environment, you can launch the notebooks
```
jupyter notebook
```
Jupyter will then launch in your web-browser.

If you are able to open any one of the notebooks and run the first cell, then you should be good to go!
